# Datadog Puppet Module

This module installs the Datadog Agent and sends Puppet reports to Datadog.

## Setup

### Requirements

The Datadog Puppet module supports Linux and Windows and is compatible with Puppet >= 4.6.x or Puppet Enterprise version >= 2016.4. For detailed information on compatibility, check the [module page on Puppet Forge][1].

### Installation

Install the [datadog_agent][1] Puppet module in your Puppet master's module path:

```shell
puppet module install datadog-datadog_agent
```

**Note**: For CentOS/RHEL versions <7.0 and for Ubuntu < 15.04, specify the service provider as `upstart`:

```conf
class{ 'datadog_agent':
    service_provider => 'upstart'
  }
```

#### Upgrading

- By default Datadog Agent v7.x is installed. To use an earlier Agent version, change the setting `agent_major_version`.
- `agent5_enable` is no longer used, as it has been replaced by `agent_major_version`.
- `agent6_extra_options` has been renamed to `agent_extra_options` since it now applies to both Agent v6 and v7.
- `agent6_log_file` has been renamed to `agent_log_file` since it now applies to both Agent v6 and v7.
- `agent5_repo_uri` and `agent6_repo_uri` become `agent_repo_uri` for all Agent versions.
- `conf_dir` and `conf6_dir` become `conf_dir` for all Agent versions.
- The repository file created on Linux is now named `datadog` for all Agent versions instead of `datadog5`/`datadog6`.

### Configuration

Once the `datadog_agent` module is installed on your `puppetserver`/`puppetmaster` (or on a masterless host), follow these configuration steps:

1. Obtain your [Datadog API key][2].
2. Specify the module to install the Datadog Agent on your nodes.

   ```conf
   include datadog_agent
   ```

    Or assign this module using the Puppet style Parameterized class:

   ```conf
   class { 'datadog_agent':
       api_key => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
   }
   ```

3. On your `puppetserver`, enable reporting:

   ```conf
   class { 'datadog_agent':
       api_key            => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
       puppet_run_reports => true,
   }
   ```

    - To support reporting, your Puppet master needs the [dogapi][3] gem installed by running the Puppet Agent on your master with this configuration or installing it manually with `gem`. You may need to restart your `puppetserver` service after installing the `dogapi` gem.
    - `puppetserver_gem` is defined as a module dependency. It is installed automatically when the module is installed.

4. (Optional) Include integrations to use with the Agent, for example:

   ```conf
   include 'datadog_agent::integrations::mongo'
   ```

    If an integration does not have a [manifest with a dedicated class][6], you can still add a configuration for it. Below is an example for the `ntp` check:

   ```conf
   class { 'datadog_agent':
       api_key      => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
       integrations => {
           "ntp" => {
               init_config => {},
               instances => [{
                   offset_threshold => 30,
               }],
           },
       },
   }
   ```

#### Integration versions

To install and pin specific integration versions, specify an integration and version number by using `datadog_agent::install_integration`. This uses the `datadog-agent integration` command to ensure a specific integration is installed or uninstalled, for example:

```conf
datadog_agent::install_integration { "mongo-1.9":
    ensure => present,
    integration_name => 'datadog-mongo',
    version => '1.9.0',
}
```

`ensure` has two options:

- `present` (default)
- `absent` (removes a previously pinned version of an integration)

### Reporting

Ensure the [dogapi][3] gem is available on your system.

To enable reporting of changes to your Datadog timeline, enable the report processor on your Puppet master and reporting for your clients. The clients send a run report after each check-in back to the master.

Set the `puppet_run_reports` option to true in the node configuration manifest for your master:

```ruby
class { "datadog-agent":
    api_key => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
    puppet_run_reports => true
    # ...
}
```

The Puppet configuration file is located in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`.


Add these configuration options to the appropriate location:

```ini
[main]
# No modification needed to this section
# ...

[master]
# Enable reporting to Datadog
reports=datadog_reports
# If you use other reports, add datadog_reports to the end,
# for example: reports=store,log,datadog_reports
# ...

[agent]
# ...
pluginsync=true
report=true
```

On all of your Puppet client nodes, add the following in the same location:

```ini
[agent]
# ...
report=true
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you see the following error, ensure `reports=datadog_reports` is defined in `[master]`, not `[main]`.

```text
err: Could not send report:
Error 400 on SERVER: Could not autoload datadog_reports:
Class Datadog_reports is already defined in Puppet::Reports
```

### Step-by-step

This is the minimal set of modifications to get started.

1. Edit `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf` to add the Puppet Agent:

    ```ini
    [master]
    report = true
    reports = datadog_reports
    pluginsync = true

    [agent]
    report = true
    pluginsync = true
    ```


2. Edit `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/10_nodes.pp` to configure your Agent:

    ```conf
    node "default" {
        class { "datadog_agent":
            api_key => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
        }
    }
    node "puppetmaster" {
        class { "datadog_agent":
            api_key            => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
            puppet_run_reports => true
        }
    }
    ```

     **Note**: For older versions of Puppet, edit `/etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp`.

3. Run the Puppet Agent:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart puppetserver
    sudo puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --no-splay --verbose
    ```

     Example response:

    ```text
    info: Retrieving plugin
    info: Caching catalog for alq-linux.dev.datadoghq.com
    info: Applying configuration version '1333470114'
    notice: Finished catalog run in 0.81 seconds
    ```

4. Verify your Puppet data is in Datadog by searching for `sources:puppet` in the [Event Stream][5].

## Masterless Puppet

1. The Datadog module and its dependencies have to be installed on all nodes running masterless.
2. Add this to each node's `site.pp` file:
    ```conf
    class { "datadog_agent":
        api_key            => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
        puppet_run_reports => true
    }
   ```

3. Configure reports in the `[main]` section of `puppet.conf`:
    ```conf
    [main]
    reports=datadog_reports
    ```
4. Run puppet in masterless configuration:
    ```shell
    puppet apply --modulepath <path_to_modules> <path_to_site.pp>
    ```

## Client settings

### Tagging client nodes

The Datadog Agent configuration file is recreated from the template every Puppet run. If you need to tag your nodes, add an array entry in Hiera:

```conf
datadog_agent::tags:
- 'keyname:value'
- 'anotherkey:%{factname}'
```

### Configuration variables

These variables can be set in the `datadog_agent` class to control settings in the Agent:

| variable name                           | description                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `agent_extra_options`<sup>1</sup>       | A hash to provide additional configuration options (Agent v6 and v7 only).                                                                                                                       |
| `hostname_extraction_regex`<sup>2</sup> | A regex used to extract the hostname captured group to report the run in Datadog instead of reporting the Puppet nodename, for example:<br>`'^(?<hostname>.*\.datadoghq\.com)(\.i-\w{8}\..*)?$'` |

(1) `agent_extra_options` is used to provide a fine grain control of additional Agent v6/v7 config options. A deep merge is performed that may override options provided in the `datadog_agent` class parameters.

(2) `hostname_extraction_regex` is useful when the Puppet module and the Datadog Agent are reporting different host names for the same host in the infrastructure list.
