# 2.0.0 / 2018-02-27

### Overview
This release is a mejor release, there are a some breaking changes. We have
tried to keep the interface as similar as possible to what the community
was already used to, but have had to make some changes and cleaned up some
of the interfaces to some classes. Most notably the main `datadog_agent`
class, and the `datadog_agent::ubuntu` and `datadog_agent::redhat`.

Most checks manifest should remain backward compatible.

Please note this new release will install datadog agent version 6.x by default.

Finally, deprecated modules and support for EOL'd puppets has been dropped
so if you're running a puppet server <= `4.5.x` or PE <= `2016.4.x` although
the module might work for some versions, it has not been tested in those
environments.

Please read the [docs]() for more details.
