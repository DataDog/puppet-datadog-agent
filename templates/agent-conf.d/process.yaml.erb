#  - name: (mandatory) STRING , It will be used to uniquely identify your metrics as they will be tagged with this name
#    search_string: (mandatory) LIST OF STRINGS If one of the element in the list matches,
#                    return the counter of all the processes that contain the string
#    exact_match: (optional) True/False, default to False, if you want to look for an arbitrary
#                 string, use exact_match: False, unless use the exact base name of the process
#    cpu_check_interval: (optional) CPU percent check interval: 0.1 - 1.0 sec. More time - more precise
