Puppet & Datadog
================

Description
-----------

A module to:

1. install the [DataDog](http://www.datadoghq.com)  agent
2. to send reports of puppet runs to the Datadog service [Datadog](http://www.datadoghq.com/).

Requirements
------------

* [puppet](http://puppetlabs.com)
* A [Datadog](http://www.datadoghq.com) account and an API Key

On your Puppet master:

* [dogapi](https://rubygems.org/gems/dogapi) gem (v 1.0.3 and later)

Installation
------------

Install `datadog` as a module in your Puppet master's module path.

     git clone https://github.com/DataDog/puppet-datadog-agent.git /etc/puppet/modules/datadog

Note that this installed the module in `/etc/puppet/modules/datadog`

Usage
-----

Once the `datadog` module is installed on your master, there's a tiny bit of configuration
that needs to be done.

1. Update the default class parameters with your [API key](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api)
   (and confirm the DataDog URL is correct in datadog::params).

2. Specify the module on any nodes you wish to install the DataDog
   Agent.

        include datadog

  Or assign this module using the Puppet 2.6 style Parameterized class:
        class { 'datadog':
          api_key => "yourkey",
        }

  On your Puppet master, enable reporting:

        class { 'datadog':
          api_key            => "yourkey",
          puppet_run_reports => true,
        }

Reporting
---------
To enable reporting of changes to the Datadog timeline, enable the report 
processor on your Puppet master, and enable reporting for your clients. 
The clients will send a run report after each check-in back to the master, 
and the master will process the reports and send them to the Datadog API.


In your Puppet master `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf`, add these configuration options:

    [main]
    # No need to modify this section
    # ...
        
    [master]
    # Enable reporting to datadog
    reports=datadog_reports
    # If you use other reports already, just add datadog_reports at the end
    # reports=store,log,datadog_reports
    # ...
    
    [agent]
    # ...
    pluginsync=true
    report=true
    
And on all of your Puppet client nodes add:

    [agent]
    # ...
    report=true
    
If you get

    err: Could not send report:
    Error 400 on SERVER: Could not autoload datadog_reports:
    Class Datadog_reports is already defined in Puppet::Reports
    
Make suer `reports=datadog_reports` is defined in **[master]**, not **[main]**.

Step-by-step
============

This is the minimal set of files to use to get started. These files assume puppet 2.7.x

/etc/puppet/puppet.conf
-----------------------

    [main]
    logdir=/var/log/puppet
    vardir=/var/lib/puppet
    ssldir=/var/lib/puppet/ssl
    rundir=/var/run/puppet
    factpath=$vardir/lib/facter
    templatedir=$confdir/templates
    
    [master]
    # These are needed when the puppetmaster is run by passenger
    # and can safely be removed if webrick is used.
    ssl_client_header = SSL_CLIENT_S_DN 
    ssl_client_verify_header = SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY
    report = true
    reports = datadog_reports
    pluginsync = true
    syslogfacility = user
    
    [agent]
    report = true
    pluginsync = true

/etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp
------------------------------

    node "default" {
        class { "datadog":
            api_key => "INSERT YOU API KEY HERE",
        }
    }
    node "YOUR NODE NAME HERE" {
        class { "datadog":
            api_key            => "INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE",
            puppet_run_reports => true
        }
    }

/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
-----------------------------

    import "nodes.pp"

Run Puppet Agent
----------------

    sudo /etc/init.d/puppetmaster restart
    sudo puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --no-splay --verbose
    
You should see something like:

    info: Retrieving plugin
    info: Caching catalog for alq-linux.dev.datadoghq.com
    info: Applying configuration version '1333470114'
    notice: Finished catalog run in 0.81 seconds

Verify on Datadog
-----------------

Go to [the Setup page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations) and you should see this
