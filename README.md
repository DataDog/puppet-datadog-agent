Puppet & Datadog
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DataDog/puppet-datadog-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DataDog/puppet-datadog-agent)

Description
-----------

A module to:

1. Install the [DataDog][1] Agent.
2. Send Puppet run reports to [Datadog][1].

Releases
--------

There are currently two actively maintained versions for the Puppet module. For users on Puppet >= 4.6.x, and possibly some older 4.x puppets, it is recommended to use version 2.0+ of the module.

For users running on older versions of Puppet the legacy module, series 1.x, should support most use-cases.

The majority of users should be able to use the newer module as many of the Puppet versions supported in the 1.x series of the module have been EOL'd.

Some features might be back-ported if there's enough demand, but in general only maintenance is performed on the 1.x series of the module. Future feature development is performed on the newer Puppet module.

Version 2.x
-----------

## Requirements

Puppet >=4.6.x and <=5.3.x (may work with newer versions, but is untested). For detailed information on compatibility, check the [module page][2] on the Puppet forge.

## Installation

Install `datadog_agent` as a module in your Puppet master's module path.

```
puppet module install datadog-datadog_agent
```

**Note**: For CentOS versions <7.0, specify the service provider as `upstart`:

```
class{ 'datadog_agent': 
    service_provider => 'upstart' 
  }
```

### Upgrade from the previous module version 1.x

Most of the manifests are backward compatible. However, there are important changes to the main manifest:

- By default Datadog Agent 6.x is installed.
  - To use Agent 5.x in your nodes set the `agent5_enable` boolean parameter to `True`.
- Enhanced support for our APM Tracing Agent.
- Enhanced support for our Process Agent.
- Enhanced support for additional `agent6` options.
- APM Tracing and Process Agents are now opt-in options and are disabled by default.
  - The main `datadog_agent` class has parameters to enable and configure the Agents easily.
- Increased granularity for apt/yum repo configuration.
- New location for Datadog Puppet reporting configuration.


Version 1.x
-----------

## Requirements

Puppet >=2.7.x and <=4.2.x (may work with newer versions, but is untested). For detailed information on compatibility, check the [module page][2] on the Puppet forge.

## Installation

Install `datadog_agent` as a module in your Puppet master's module path.

```
puppet module install datadog-datadog_agent --version 1.12.1
```

### Upgrade from previous git manual install 0.x (unreleased)

You can keep using the `datadog` module but it becomes legacy with the release of `datadog_agent` 1.0.0. Upgrade to get new features, and use the Puppet forge system which is easier for maintenance.

* Delete the Datadog module `rm -r /etc/puppet/modules/datadog`
* Install the new module from the Puppet forge `puppet module install datadog-datadog_agent`
* Update your manifests with the new module class, basically replace `datadog` by `datadog_agent`

Usage
-----

The following instructions are for both Puppet module versions (1.x, 2.x).

Note: 2.x installs Agent v6 by default, whereas 1.x defaults to Agent v5.

Once the `datadog_agent` module is installed on your `puppetserver`/`puppetmaster`, follow these configuration steps:

1. Update the default class parameters with your [API key][3].

2. Specify the module on any nodes you wish to install the DataDog Agent.

    ```
    include datadog_agent
    ```

    Or assign this module using the Puppet style Parameterized class:

        ```
        class { 'datadog_agent':
            api_key => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
        }
        ```

    On your `puppetserver`, enable reporting:

        ```
        class { 'datadog_agent':
            api_key            => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
            puppet_run_reports => true,
        }
        ```

    - To support reporting, your Puppet master needs the [dogapi][4] gem installed. To install, either run the Puppet Agent on your master with this configuration or install it manually with `gem`. You might need to restart your `puppetserver` service for the freshly installed `dogapi-rb` gem to be picked up.
    - On version 2.x, `puppetserver_gem` is defined as a module dependency, it is installed automatically when the module is installed.
    - On version 1.x:
      - If you are on Puppet Enterprise or POSS (ie. >=3.7.0), there is a soft dependency for reporting on the `puppetserver_gem` module. Install with `puppet module install puppetlabs-puppetserver_gem` - installing manually with `gem` does *not* work.
      - You may install `dogapi-rb` with `gem` as the system-level Ruby is used.
      - The gem provider is configurable by setting it to `puppetserver_gem` (set by default on PE/POSS (>=3.7.0)) or `gem` if on older versions of Puppet.

3. Include any other integrations you want the agent to use, for example:

    ```
    include 'datadog_agent::integrations::mongo'
    ```

    Some integrations do not come as a dedicated class. To install one of them, add its configuration in the manifest. Below is an example for the `ntp` check:

    ```
    class { 'datadog_agent':
        api_key      => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
        integrations => {
            "ntp" => {
                init_config => {},
                instances => [{
                    offset_threshold => 30,
                }],
            },
        },
    }
    ```

Reporting
---------
Ensure `dogapi-rb` is available on your system as explained earlier.

To enable reporting of changes to the Datadog timeline, enable the report processor on your Puppet master, and enable reporting for your clients. The clients send a run report after each check-in back to the master.

Set the `puppet_run_reports` option to true in the node configuration manifest for your master:

```ruby
class { "datadog-agent":
    api_key => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
    puppet_run_reports => true
    # ...
}
```

On Puppet >=4.x the location for your configuration file is `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`.

On older Puppets, the location is `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf`.

Add these configuration options in the pertinent location:

```ini
[main]
# No need to modify this section
# ...

[master]
# Enable reporting to Datadog
reports=datadog_reports
# If you use other reports already, just add datadog_reports at the end
# reports=store,log,datadog_reports
# ...

[agent]
# ...
pluginsync=true
report=true
```

On all of your Puppet client nodes add the following in the same location:

```ini
[agent]
# ...
report=true
```

If you see the following, ensure `reports=datadog_reports` is defined in **[master]**, not **[main]**.

```
err: Could not send report:
Error 400 on SERVER: Could not autoload datadog_reports:
Class Datadog_reports is already defined in Puppet::Reports
```


Step-by-step
============

This is the minimal set of modifications to get started. These files assume Puppet 4.5.x or higher.

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
-----------------------
```ini
    [master]
    report = true
    reports = datadog_reports
    pluginsync = true

    [agent]
    report = true
    pluginsync = true
```

_Note: This may be file `/etc/puppet/puppet/puppet.conf` on older puppets_

/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/10_nodes.pp
------------------------------

```
node "default" {
    class { "datadog_agent":
        api_key => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
    }
}
node "puppetmaster" {
    class { "datadog_agent":
        api_key            => "<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>",
        puppet_run_reports => true
    }
}
```

_Note: This may be file `/etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp` on older puppets_


Run Puppet Agent
----------------

```
sudo systemctl  /etc/init.d/puppetmaster restart
sudo puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --no-splay --verbose
```

Example response:

```
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for alq-linux.dev.datadoghq.com
info: Applying configuration version '1333470114'
notice: Finished catalog run in 0.81 seconds
```

Verify on Datadog
-----------------

1. Search for `puppet` on [the Integrations page][5]. The Puppet integration tile displays the install status.

2. Search for `sources:puppet` in the [Event Stream][6] to see your Puppet events.

Masterless Puppet
=================

To use this specific setup, see https://gist.github.com/LeoCavaille/cd412c7a9ff5caec462f. This applies to older puppets and is untested on >=4.x Puppet versions.


Client Settings
===============

### Tagging client nodes

The Datadog Agent configuration file is recreated from the template every Puppet run. If you need to tag your nodes, add an array entry in Hiera:

```
datadog_agent::tags:
- 'keyname:value'
- 'anotherkey:%{factname}'
```

These variables can be set in the `datadog_agent` class to control settings in the Agent:

##### Notes:

- `agent6_extra_options` is used to provide a fine grain control of additional Agent v6 config options. A deep merge is performed that may override options provided in the `datadog_agent` class parameters.
- `hostname_extraction_regex` is useful when the Puppet module and the Datadog Agent are reporting different host names for the same host in the infrastructure list.
